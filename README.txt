This project was created during my learning experience at Full Sail.

WARNING: This code is currently being polished; warnings and messy code are probably currently part of 
it but I'll continue to correct these and optimize it every chance I get.
 
The non-graphics code for this project was provided by the university as a
base to work on; this code had a basic cube implementetion (that I believe is actually a Microsoft sample.) 
I have no experience with UWP implementations (at this point in time 4/28/2019).That being said, I do have 
experience implementing direct C++ windows implementations of DirectX11 graphics, the reason we used this 
base code provided was due to time contraints.

The 3D model used for this software was provided by a friend who has decided to remain anonymous
for the purposes of this project. Nevertheless, I have basics experience in 3D Modeling.

Any and all images used for this project were provided by the university or selected from the internet
under "flagged for non-commercial reuse" licenses. I do not have the power to redistribute these freely.
